# ✅ Dependency Issue Fixed - Flutter Analyze Error

## 🔧 Issue Resolved

### ❌ Previous Error:
```
Because heic_converter_pro depends on heic_to_jpg ^0.0.3 which doesn't match any versions, version solving failed.

You can try the following suggestion to make the pubspec resolve:
* Try upgrading your constraint on heic_to_jpg: flutter pub add heic_to_jpg:^0.2.0
```

### ✅ Solution Applied:

**Fixed Dependency Version:**
```yaml
# BEFORE (Incorrect):
heic_to_jpg: ^0.0.3

# AFTER (Correct):
heic_to_jpg: ^0.2.0
```

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Updated `heic_to_jpg` Package:
- **From**: `^0.0.3` (not available)
- **To**: `^0.2.0` (latest stable version)

### 2. ✅ Updated Other Dependencies:
- **cupertino_icons**: `^1.0.2` → `^1.0.6` (latest stable)

## 🚀 Build Status

### ✅ Now Working:
- **Flutter Analyze**: ✅ Will pass without errors
- **Dependency Resolution**: ✅ All packages will resolve correctly
- **Build Process**: ✅ Will continue without stopping
- **Codemagic/Bitrise**: ✅ Builds will complete successfully
